\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course discusses a number of topics in \emph{epistemology}, the
theory of knowledge. We will start with a very brief survey of some
recent debates, mainly to ensure everyone is up to speed with what is
assumed in the readings later in the course. Then the bulk of the course
will be devoted to working through two recent books: \emph{After
Certainty} by Robert Pasnau, and \emph{The Rationality of Perception} by
Susanna Siegel. These books are designed to complement one another.
Pasnau's book is a history of how European epistemology developed the
way it did, focussing on two key periods, the early 14th century and the
late 17th century. Siegel's book engages with contemporary empirical
work on perception and, via considerations of the social and political
significance of some features of perception, comes to a new view on the
role of perception in epistemology. So hopefully looking at some
contemporary work in light of historical work will give us fresh
insights into both.

\hypertarget{canvas}{%
\section{Canvas}\label{canvas}}

There is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from
\url{https://canvas.umich.edu}. Course documents (syllabus, lecture
notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure
that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for
announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are
many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.

\newpage

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

There are two books for the course. Both of them are available through
the bookstore. You do not need physical versions of the books; I'll be
primarily teaching off the electronic versions. The books are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{After Certainty: A History of Our Epistemic Ideals and
  Illusions}, by Robert Pasnau. Oxford University Press, 2017.
\item
  \emph{The Rationality of Perception}, by Susanna Siegel. Oxford
  University Press, 2017.
\end{itemize}

Note that in class we'll be working through the main text of Pasnau's
book, not the hundreds of pages of endnotes. These are not required
reading, but I do encourage you to dip into them if you're interested in
more detail on any of the points. The endnotes are basically blog posts,
sometimes short essays, expanding on the text, and often filling in
fascinating historical detail. But I'm not expecting everyone to read
all of them in the middle of term.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Participate in discussion section. This will require that you have
  read the relevant material closely, and thought about what to say
  about it. And it will require that you then participate in the
  discussions in section. This will help you learn, and it will help
  your classmates learn.
\item
  Do three online quizzes. At the end of each section of the course,
  there will be a short quiz to do on Canvas. This will be timed, though
  you can take it at a time of your own choosing. The quizzes will be
  multiple choice.
\item
  Write three short essays. You will have to write a short paper, around
  1500-2000 words, on each of the three sections of the course. Topics
  will be distributed well in advance.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{grade-breakdown}{%

\item
  Discussion section participation: 10\%;
\item
  Three Quizzes: 10\% each, for a total of 30\%;
\item
  Three Essays: 20\% each, for a total of 60\%.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

The course is in three parts: Introduction, which is weeks 1-5, Pasnau,
which is weeks 6-8, and Siegel, which is weeks 9-12. We will do some
revision and general discussion of things that have come up in the
course after that.

\hypertarget{grading-schema}{%
\section{Grading Schema}\label{grading-schema}}

By default, we've set up Canvas with the automatic system for converting
numerical grades to letter grades. If the questions turn out to be
harder than we expected, we might move those numbers around a little bit
- the line betwen a B+ and an A- might get moved down a point or two. We
won't move any of the lines up though - so the changes can only improve
your letter grade.

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\section{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

Although team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is
strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of
your work is plagiarized. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct
quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably
clear is permitted, but if you'd like a good description of a citation
scheme that works well in philosophy, look at
\url{http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4}.

You are encouraged to discuss the course material, including
assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in
under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work
of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of
the work. (Note that when you're submitting work on Canvas, you have to
each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows
that everyone has turned in work.)

You should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the
College of Literature, Science \& the Arts at the University of
Michigan, which are available here:
\url{http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/}. Violations of these
policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for
Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.

\hypertarget{disability}{%
\section{Disability}\label{disability}}

The University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other
applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the
basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be
provided for qualified students with disabilities.

If you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional
and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the
semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to
register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The
office is located at G664 Haven Hall.

For more information on disability services at the University of
Michigan, go to \url{http://ssd.umich.edu}.

\newpage

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

The readings will all be from the three textbooks. I've produced short
videos going over the material in the books, and occasionally other
philosophically interesting points. Then the time in class will be
entirely spent on questions people have, and going over worked examples.
So you should do the reading, and watch the lectures, before the
scheduled class.

Most of the readings are from the two textbooks. The other readings are
all in the UM library or online. You might have to be logged in to UM to
get them though. The names of the papers are links to a source where you
can get a copy of the paper.

The video lectures will have a number of the form \(x.y\), where \(x\)
is the week they are for, and the \(y\) is their order in the week. You
should watch these \textbf{before} class, and we can discuss the
material in class.

Most weeks have a fairly simple structure. There are in person classes
with me on Tuesday and Thursday, and you have a smaller in person class
with Mica as well. There are video lectures before each of my classes.
And at the end of the week there is a Canvas quiz assigned about the
material we covered. But there are exceptions, especially around late
January-early February. I'm going to be away on \textbf{January 27}, and
that leads to the following complications.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is no in person class with me on Thursday, January 27.
\item
  The assignment in week 4 will just be about the material through class
  on Tuesday, January 25.
\item
  There is no assignment in week 5.
\item
  The assignment in week 6 will be about the material through class on
  Thursday, February 3, i.e., the end of week 5.
\item
  The assignment in week 7 will cover the material in weeks 6 and 7.
\end{itemize}

There is also no assignment the week after Spring Break, so we can all
get a bit of a soft relaunch of the term before the final push to the
end of term.
