Pasnau Ch 6 Notes

1. Two (or more) retreats from the ideal.
  - Going to probability vs going to "true unless weird stuff"
2. What is question-begging.
  - Is it an epistemic flaw or a social flaw
  - "Justified" suggests we can justify something to someone.
  - But really, why expect non-question-begging grounds. They seem to be relevant to KK only.
  - Really hard to justify the desire for this, unless it is important to win all arguments.
3. Belief and credence dualism
  - Explain what it is.
  - How it solves the problem.
  - I'm very sceptical; what are the priors, and how do they update?
