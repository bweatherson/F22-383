# Siegel's Response

## Two Responses

1. Focus on realistic cases;
2. Look at what people actually do to see what's intuitive.

## Realistic Cases

Pautz's cases involve all sorts of weirdness.

- First, there are people who anticipate weird things like red, round spheres.
- Second, there are evil demons put on top of this detail.

## Siegel's Cases

Siegel's cases are much more realistic.

- Some of them are cases of wishful seeing.
- And others are cases of racist perception.

## Principle

Take intuitions about realistic cases more seriously than intuitions about unrealistic cases.

- I guess that sounds fine as far as it goes, but it relies on the intuitions going Siegel's way (fairly decisively) in the realistic cases.

## Protests

So here's a fact that seems to support Siegel's view: there are often mass protests after shootings where the perpetrator (usually a police officer) hallucinated a gun.

## Siegel's Argument

I think this implicit argument here is something like this.

1. People don't protest things they think are justified.
2. On traditional views of perception, like Pautz's, these shootings would be justified.
3. So ordinary people do not in fact have the intuitions that Pautz needs them to have (in these tragically realistic cases).

## Protests

This all goes by very quickly in a couple of page response, but as it stands I didn't find that particularly persuasive. So I just wanted to note a few challenges in getting from the existence of the protests to Siegel like conclusions.

## Lying

For one thing, the protestors might have thought the officers were simply lying about what perceptions they had.

- It's kind of odd that Siegel, in the context of arguing that these officers are guilty of a distinctive kind of irrationality, seems to take their word for what kind of perception they had.

## Self-Defence

This is a bit more theoretical, but the protestors might have had a strict liability theory of self-defence.

- This could either be a strict liability theory about the **morality** of self-defence, or about the **legality** of self-defence.
- The legal claim would be very strange I think; not completely implausible but a long way from our actual cultural norms.

## Self-Defence

The moral claim is a bit more plausible.

- Think about someone who has a completely blameless but mistaken view that a third party poses a danger to them, and they seriously injure the perceived attacker.
- Don't we think they should feel some guilt or remorse, and (morally) owe their victim at least an apology and maybe compensation?

## Structural

Most plausibly, the protestors could be protesting the institutions that created this danger as much as the individual police officer.

- Even if the officer's actions were completely rational, there is a very good complaint against a system that puts people prone to make *this* mistake in a situation where it will cause *this* harm.

## Structural

I'm worried I've lost the dialectic a bit here but I think it's fairly hard to get from the known facts to the conclusion Siegel draws that the protests are "a living disagreement about whether the beliefs are reasonable".

- There are just too many other things the protests could be about.

## For Next Time

- Anything you want to discuss about essays, quizzes, the other papers, or the books/readings.
