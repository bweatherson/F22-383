# Where and When

## Don't Hope for Precision

- We don't have nearly as good a sense of where and when the classical Indian texts were written as we do for a lot of Western texts.
- It's a lot more like the situation with Homer and Hesiod (or the Bible) than with Plato and Aristotle.

## Roughly

- The foundational works are mostly written pre 0 CE, or not that long after.
- But a lot of the more developed works are late first millenium CE or early second millenium CE.

## Where

- I'm calling this all "Indian philosophy", but don't think that this means that it call came from within the present-day country called **India** any more than "European philosophy" all comes from within what we now call Europe.
- On the latter, plenty of important documents from antiquity are from Asia (at least from Asian parts of Turkey) or North Africa.

## Where

- Mostly within present-day India.
- But some from within present-day Nepal and Bangladesh.
- And maybe some from within present-day Pakistan and perhaps Bhutan.

# Pramāṇa

## Common Assumptions

- All knowledge come from a pramāṇa of some form or another.
- There are finitely many of these.

## Etymology

- Pramāṇa literally means proof.
- So to know something is to have a proof of it.
- This suggests that there is a connection between knowledge and certainty.
- And yet most schools do not think that pramāṇas can only lead to very abstract mathematical knowledge.

## Infallibility

- A knowledge-source produces knowledge.
- So if something does not produce knowledge, it produces false beliefs or lucky guesses, then it isn't a knowledge-source.
- So we may not be able to tell from the inside whether we are using a knowledge-source or not.

## Two Cases

1. Sumeet tells me that it's raining and it is raining, and indeed he just came in from the rain. I come to know that it's raining by the pramāṇa Śabda (or Word).
2. Sumeet tells me that it's raining but he's playing a trick, and just wants me to stay inside away from the nice weather. I don't get knowledge, so I must not be using Śabda.

## Transparency

- The schools differ some on this, but most accept that we don't always know what method we're using.
- For every pramāṇa, there is something that we might call a psuedo-pramāṇa, that feels a lot like it from the inside, but is crucially different.

## Disjunctivism

- In contemporary epistemology of perception, this kind of position is sometimes called **disjunctivism**.
- The idea is that perceiving an apple and hallucinating an apple are fundamentally different kinds of experience, even if occasionally one may not be able to tell the difference.
- What philosophers used to call "Having an apple-like experience" is a disjunction: you're either seeing an apple **or** hallucinating an apple.

# Scepticism

## Scepticism

- There were sceptics in classical Indian philosophy; indeed, there were entire sceptical schools.
- But most of them were not sceptics.
- The reason for rejecting scepticism was quite distinctive.

## Disjunctive Responses to Scepticism

- A lot of contemporary philosophers adopt disjunctivism as a way of responding to the sceptic.
- They say the sceptic doesn't realise that things like appearances of an apple are disjunctive.
- A real perception of an apple isn't the same thing as a hallucination, so we don't have to worry about confusing them.

## Classical Indian Responses to Scepticism

- A lot of these philosophers were disjunctivists, but this doesn't seem to have been a big part of the response to scepticism.
- Instead, the response is **pragmatic**.

## An Anti-Sceptical Argument

1. Some actions are sensible and some are stupid.
2. The difference between sensible actions and stupid ones is that sensible ones are properly grounded in knowledge.
3. So some people at least, the ones who perform sensible actions, know a lot.

## Ordinary Language

- There is a strong default across the schools that things we ordinarily say are true unless proven otherwise.
- I can't stress enough how much everything I've said so far is extremely commonplace in Anglophone philosophy post-circa-1950, and miles outside the European mainstream for the preceding several centuries.

## Ordinary Language and Scepticism

There is another anti-sceptical argument around here.

1. We talk all the time as if people know stuff.
2. What we say is usually correct.
3. So lots of people know stuff.

## Ordinary Truth

- A hallucination wouldn't be a hallucination of an apple unless we often saw apples.
- The words in a lie wouldn't have the meaning they have unless they were usually used in true sentences.
- Both suggest that vision and speech must usually be accurate.
- And this might have epistemological consequences.

## A Thought Experiment

- There is a world that is physically just like this one, down to the atomic level.
- But in it the word 'cat' means dog and 'dog' means cat, so when people say "The cat is on the mat", they usually speak falsely.
- Is this coherent? 
- If not why not?

## Two Sceptical Arguments

- In Ancient Greek/Roman epistemology, there are two sceptical arguments.
- These are known as Academic Scepticism and Pyrrhonian Scepticism.
- Rather than filling them out, I'll set up the very brief versions of each.
