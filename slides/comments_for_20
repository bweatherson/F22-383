Plans for class 20

Why the pink drink and the bird
- One is an object another an event
- Are they likely to be different?

Diff b/w reason-power and forward-power
- Providing a reason vs making well-founded
- Sort of backwards-looking vs forward-looking
- Except it's forward to a backwards thing

Can have reason-power without well-founded
- E.g., if you don't actually do it/believe it
- Or if it is such a weak reason that it would be overridden

Can you have well-founded without reason?
- Eh, maybe if things can be founded in things other than reasons
- Maybe they can be founded in reliable capacities
- Get into very murky territory about the metaphysics of reasons here - not going to go there

-----

Do these errors affect the powers, or just knowledge
- Compare what a lot of folks say about evil demons
- The evil demon victim is justified, but lacks knowledge
- Why isn't it the same

Does Siegel have something like a new evil demon problem
- Maybe no, because they are the victim of themselves, in a way

Four theories of perceptual justification

1. Disjunctivist/Naive realist
  - This doesn't have any problems; you're in the bad disjunct in her four cases
2. Reliabilist
  - Again no problem; these aren't actually reliable
3. Inferentialist
  - Here things might get dubious, because it depends a bit on the inference
  - But there is a natural way out, and I think it would be easy to take it
4. Dogmatist
  - This is where things are interesting
  - And it's why we have all the stuff about defeat
  - Really interesting to think through the needs a licence vs needs to lack a defeater
