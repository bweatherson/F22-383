## Is Testimony a Basic Knowledge Source

Lots of reasons to think it might not be.

1. People deceive us, either intentionally or unintentionally.
2. Sources differ.
3. Testimony isn't independent of other sources.

## Is Testimony a Basic Knowledge Source

None of these are conclusive, since they all overgenerate.

1. Looks can be deceiving.
2. Things look different from different angles.
3. Inference isn't independent.

## Why Might Testimony be Basic

1. In practice we act like it is.
2. It would be impossible to not act like it is (perhaps especially in childhood).
3. Language must be mostly correct in order to work.

## Plan for Today

1. Happy to answer any questions about the reading.
2. But my priority is explaining background, because this intersects a lot of debates inside and outside philosophy.

# Reductionism

## Two Approaches to Testimony

1. Reductionism
2. Anti-Reductionism

## Anti-Reductionism

This is basically the testimony is a pramana position.

## Anti-Reductionism

Two aspects, that don't need to go together.

- Evaluative: People can do well by taking speakers at their word.
- Psychological: People in fact take speakers at their word.

## Motivations for Anti-Reductionism

- Mostly carried over (well, belatedly rediscovered) from Indian traditions.
- But one new motivation, a focus on infants and toddlers.
- They couldn't learn if reductionism were true.

## Reductionism

Testimony is not a pramana.

- It reduces fundamentally to perception + inference.

## Standard form of testimonial inference

1. Speaker said that p.
2. This speaker is generally reliable (perhaps known, perhaps reasoned from background).
3. This speaker has no reason to deceive.
4. So, probably, p.

## Two Distinct Claims

- Good hearers go through something like this inference.
- Real hearers (typically) go through something like this inference.

## Sperber et al

Both those claims are true.

# Rationality Wars

## A Very Brief History

- Late C20 psychology included included big trend of arguing that people are much less rational than they seem.
- Early C21 has featured some pushback to this.
- This paper is (a kind of important) part of the pushback.

## Heuristics and Biases

![Thinking Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman](../images/kahneman.png){height=60%}

## Heuristics and Biases

- Work Kahneman did with Amos Tversky.
- What looks like intelligent behavior is mostly a set of heuristics, i.e., short-cuts.

## System 1 and System 2

- Kahneman's own view is that there is a core of something like traditional rationality.
- This is system 2, the slow of "Thinking Fast and Slow".
- But most of what we do, and everything we do fast, is basically automatic.



# Background

## Two Theories of Cultural Evolution

1. Copying
2. Rational adoption

## Paris School

- The key moves in cultural evolution are rational.
- But they aren't always conscious.

## Why Replication

- We see someone doing X and succeeding in a certain way.
- We want to succeed in that same way.
- We infer, fallibly, sub-consciously, that the are succeeding because of X.
- So we do X as well.

## Distinctive Features of Paris

- We won't always make that inference.
- We will tinker if we have reason to believe that we can improve.
- We will reject if we have reason to believe that X won't work for us.

## To be Sure

- The believers in replication know that people are not robots, and think for themselves.
- The believers in rational adoption know that we make mistakes.
- But there is a difference in emphasis, that is interesting.
