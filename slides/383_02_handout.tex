\begin{frame}{Don't Hope for Precision}
\protect\hypertarget{dont-hope-for-precision}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  We don't have nearly as good a sense of where and when the classical
  Indian texts were written as we do for a lot of Western texts.
\item
  It's a lot more like the situation with Homer and Hesiod (or the
  Bible) than with Plato and Aristotle.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Roughly}
\protect\hypertarget{roughly}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  The foundational works are mostly written pre 0 CE, or not that long
  after.
\item
  But a lot of the more developed works are late first millennium CE or
  early second millennium CE.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where}
\protect\hypertarget{where}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  I'm calling this all ``Indian philosophy'', but don't think that this
  means that it call came from within the present-day country called
  \textbf{India} any more than ``European philosophy'' all comes from
  within what we now call Europe.
\item
  On the latter, plenty of important documents from antiquity are from
  Asia (at least from Asian parts of Turkey) or North Africa.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where}
\protect\hypertarget{where-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Mostly within present-day India.
\item
  But some from within present-day Nepal and Bangladesh.
\item
  And maybe some from within present-day Pakistan and perhaps Bhutan.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Common Assumptions}
\protect\hypertarget{common-assumptions}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  All knowledge come from a pramāṇa of some form or another.
\item
  There are finitely many of these.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Etymology}
\protect\hypertarget{etymology}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Pramāṇa literally means proof.
\item
  So to know something is to have a proof of it.
\item
  This suggests that there is a connection between knowledge and
  certainty.
\item
  And yet most schools do not think that pramāṇas can only lead to very
  abstract mathematical knowledge.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Infallibility}
\protect\hypertarget{infallibility}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  A knowledge-source produces knowledge.
\item
  So if something does not produce knowledge, it produces false beliefs
  or lucky guesses, then it isn't a knowledge-source.
\item
  So we may not be able to tell from the inside whether we are using a
  knowledge-source or not.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two Cases}
\protect\hypertarget{two-cases}{}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Sumeet tells me that it's raining and it is raining, and indeed he
  just came in from the rain. I come to know that it's raining by the
  pramāṇa Śabda (or Word).
\item
  Sumeet tells me that it's raining but he's playing a trick, and just
  wants me to stay inside away from the nice weather. I don't get
  knowledge, so I must not be using Śabda.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transparency}
\protect\hypertarget{transparency}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  The schools differ some on this, but most accept that we don't always
  know what method we're using.
\item
  For every pramāṇa, there is something that we might call a
  psuedo-pramāṇa, that feels a lot like it from the inside, but is
  crucially different.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Disjunctivism}
\protect\hypertarget{disjunctivism}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  In contemporary epistemology of perception, this kind of position is
  sometimes called \textbf{disjunctivism}.
\item
  The idea is that perceiving an apple and hallucinating an apple are
  fundamentally different kinds of experience, even if occasionally one
  may not be able to tell the difference.
\item
  What philosophers used to call ``Having an apple-like experience'' is
  a disjunction: you're either seeing an apple \textbf{or} hallucinating
  an apple.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\hypertarget{scepticism}{%
\section{Scepticism}\label{scepticism}}

\begin{frame}{Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{scepticism-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  There were sceptics in classical Indian philosophy; indeed, there were
  entire sceptical schools.
\item
  But most of them were not sceptics.
\item
  The reason for rejecting scepticism was quite distinctive.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Disjunctive Responses to Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{disjunctive-responses-to-scepticism}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  A lot of contemporary philosophers adopt disjunctivism as a way of
  responding to the sceptic.
\item
  They say the sceptic doesn't realise that things like appearances of
  an apple are disjunctive.
\item
  A real perception of an apple isn't the same thing as a hallucination,
  so we don't have to worry about confusing them.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical Indian Responses to Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{classical-indian-responses-to-scepticism}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  A lot of these philosophers were disjunctivists, but this doesn't seem
  to have been a big part of the response to scepticism.
\item
  Instead, the response is \textbf{pragmatic}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Anti-Sceptical Argument}
\protect\hypertarget{an-anti-sceptical-argument}{}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Some actions are sensible and some are stupid.
\item
  The difference between sensible actions and stupid ones is that
  sensible ones are properly grounded in knowledge.
\item
  So some people at least, the ones who perform sensible actions, know a
  lot.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ordinary Language}
\protect\hypertarget{ordinary-language}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  There is a strong default across the schools that things we ordinarily
  say are true unless proven otherwise.
\item
  I can't stress enough how much everything I've said so far is
  extremely commonplace in Anglophone philosophy post-circa-1950, and
  miles outside the European mainstream for the preceding several
  centuries.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ordinary Language and Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{ordinary-language-and-scepticism}{}
There is another anti-sceptical argument around here.

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  We talk all the time as if people know stuff.
\item
  What we say is usually correct.
\item
  So lots of people know stuff.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ordinary Truth}
\protect\hypertarget{ordinary-truth}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  A hallucination wouldn't be a hallucination of an apple unless we
  often saw apples.
\item
  The words in a lie wouldn't have the meaning they have unless they
  were usually used in true sentences.
\item
  Both suggest that vision and speech must usually be accurate.
\item
  And this might have epistemological consequences.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Thought Experiment}
\protect\hypertarget{a-thought-experiment}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  There is a world that is physically just like this one, down to the
  atomic level.
\item
  But in it the word `cat' means dog and `dog' means cat, so when people
  say ``The cat is on the mat'', they usually speak falsely.
\item
  Is this coherent?
\item
  If not why not?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two Sceptical Arguments}
\protect\hypertarget{two-sceptical-arguments}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  In Ancient Greek/Roman epistemology, there are two sceptical
  arguments.
\item
  These are known as Academic Scepticism and Pyrrhonian Scepticism.
\item
  Rather than filling them out, I'll set up the very brief versions of
  each.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Philosophical Strategy}
\protect\hypertarget{a-philosophical-strategy}{}
\textasciitilde{}\href{../images/underpants.jpeg}{~}\{height=60\%)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Academic Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{academic-scepticism}{}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  For any belief \(p\), you could have had the same inputs while
  \(\neg p\).
\item
  ????
\item
  Therefore, you don't know that \(p\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pyrrhonian Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{pyrrhonian-scepticism}{}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  For any belief that \(p\), you only know \(p\) if you know you
  acquired the belief via a good method (a pramāṇa).
\item
  So if you know \(p\), you must know something else.
\item
  ???
\item
  So, you don't know that \(p\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Back to India}
\protect\hypertarget{back-to-india}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Both these sceptical arguments are in the Indian tradition.
\item
  What's distinctive (a bit distinctive at least) is how anti-sceptics
  respond.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Academic Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{academic-scepticism-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  We've already seen one response to Academic Scepticism that is popular
  nowadays, but really isn't a big part of European(/West Asian/North
  African) replies.
\item
  If you know \(p\), there is in fact not another scenario where you use
  the \textbf{same} method and \(p\) is false.
\item
  That's because you used a pramāṇa to know \(p\), and would use a
  psuedo-pramāṇa to falsely believe it.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pyrrhonian Scepticism}
\protect\hypertarget{pyrrhonian-scepticism-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Academic scepticism is limited to the external world.
\item
  There isn't a nearby scenario where I reason mathematically the same
  way, but two plus two is in fact not four.
\item
  But the pyrrhonian sceptical argument is universal; anything is
  subject to it.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Slingshot}
\protect\hypertarget{slingshot}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  This is an obvious problem, since it means that the pyrrhonian sceptic
  doesn't know that pyrrhonian scepticism is true.
\item
  And this means their position is unstable, a fact that critics on both
  sides of the Indus river pointed out.
\item
  This is what is meant by saying the position involves a ``pragmatic
  contradiction''.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Further Replies}
\protect\hypertarget{further-replies}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  But this just shows that the position does go wrong, not where it goes
  wrong.
\item
  And there is an interesting division among the Indian schools on this
  point.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Self-Certification}
\protect\hypertarget{self-certification}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  The threat is that one piece of knowledge requires an infinite amount
  of knowledge, which we don't have.
\item
  One response, taken by Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta philosophers, is to deny
  that we need an infinite amount of knowledge.
\item
  At some level, our knowledge that \(p\) just is our knowledge that our
  knowledge that \(p\) is known (by that very method).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pain}
\protect\hypertarget{pain}{}
Compare these things.

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Having a sharp headache.
\item
  Knowing that you have a sharp headache.
\end{enumerate}

\pause Could these be different? Could you have one without the other?
If not, perhaps they are just the same thing? The headache is
self-certifying, and maybe knowledge is too.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Deny the Premise}
\protect\hypertarget{deny-the-premise}{}
The other option, which Nyāya philosophers take, is to simply deny step
1.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  To know \(p\) requires that the method by which the belief was formed
  was in fact a pramāṇa.
\item
  But we don't need to know that it was.
\item
  At most, we need to not have good reason to believe it was not.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\hypertarget{perception}{%
\section{Perception}\label{perception}}

\begin{frame}{Universals}
\protect\hypertarget{universals}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Imagine I see Sumeet walking, perhaps walking in Angell Hall.
\item
  What, precisely, do I see?
\item
  One question: Do I see \textbf{Sumeet}, or just a bundle of properties
  that lets me, cognitively, non-perceptually, identify Sumeet.
\item
  Another question: Do I see walkingness as a property of Sumeet (at
  that time)? Do I see \textbf{that} Sumeet is walking?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Individuals and Universals}
\protect\hypertarget{individuals-and-universals}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  To see that Sumeet is walking, to see as it were Sumeet under the
  guise of walkingness, both the individual (Sumeet) and the property
  (walkingness) have to exist.
\item
  We might have metaphysical reasons for rejecting each of these.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{No Individuals}
\protect\hypertarget{no-individuals}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  If you have a strong no-self view, then perhaps Sumeet doesn't really
  exist, so he can't be seen.
\item
  Or perhaps you think only momentary individuals exist, and identifying
  any sequence of them with Sumeet is arbitrary.
\item
  I'm not going to go into the metaphysics of no-self theories; I
  struggle enough explaining Hindu theories to try and get Buddhist
  ones.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modern European Philosophy}
\protect\hypertarget{modern-european-philosophy}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  But this view, at least the perceptual version of it, becomes a really
  big deal in European philosophy from mid-C18 onwards, thanks to David
  Hume.
\item
  Who might, maybe, have been influenced by Buddhist thinking, though
  that's really a story for another class.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Nyāya vs Yogācāra}
\protect\hypertarget{nyux101ya-vs-yogux101cux101ra}{}
The two schools that the SEP article focuses on though do not worry
about individuals, but about properties.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Nyāya philosophers think that one really can perceive proposition like
  things, like that Sumeet is walking.
\item
  Yogācāra think that we just perceive objects, like Sumeet.
\item
  So they are really the opposite of the Buddhist/Humean position that
  we only perceive features, not individuals.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Persistence}
\protect\hypertarget{persistence}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  To be sure, I'm not sure it's fair to say the Yogācāra think we
  perceive continuing things, like Sumeet.
\item
  We just perceive objects, and maybe by cognition (perhaps mistaken
  cognition) we put these things into continuants.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Realism vs Nominalism}
\protect\hypertarget{realism-vs-nominalism}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  One reason they don't want to say that we perceive things like
  walkingness is that they don't believe in properties.
\item
  They are what came to be called \textbf{nominalists}, they don't
  believe that properties are real.
\item
  Perhaps better is to call them \textbf{projectivists}; what we call
  properties are really patterns that we project onto the world.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Details}
\protect\hypertarget{details}{}
But surely there is a difference between seeing Sumeet standing and
seeing him sitting.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  The Yogācāra need not deny that.
\item
  A natural move (no idea if they make it, but it would fit) is to adopt
  what became known as an \textbf{adverbial} position on perception.
\item
  We might see Sumeet ``walkingly'', where the adverb modifies the
  seeing, not the thing seen.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two Questions for Nyāya}
\protect\hypertarget{two-questions-for-nyux101ya}{}
But the Nyāya position is surely more natural. And it makes sense to
focus on why we might give it up.

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Metaphysical scruples about properties/propositions.
\item
  Whether the view can account for illusions.
\item
  How we acquire the concepts we (allegedly) deploy in perception.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Illusion}
\protect\hypertarget{illusion}{}
The picture here is simple; perception is good and pure, but upset by
bad human cognition.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Perception is simple, but illusion is always complex.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Acquisition}
\protect\hypertarget{acquisition}{}
The Nyāya were not \textbf{nativists}, they did not think that concepts
like \textbf{walking} were innate.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Instead, they thought that we had a handful of Yogācāra like
  perceptions as infants, and from those we directly acquired concepts
  like \textbf{walking}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{For Next Time}
\protect\hypertarget{for-next-time}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Other pramāṇa, with a little on forms of non-deductive knowledge, but
  the majority on whether testimony is a pramāṇa.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
