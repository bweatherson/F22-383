- Feel free to put your hand up to ask questions a lot.
- I will be asking you some questions too.

## Demographics

How many people here are:

- Cog Sci majors?
- PPE majors?
- Philosophy majors?
- Some other major?

## Demographics

How many people here have previously taken:

- 0-1 philosophy classes?

## Skills

Why are we going to read about what some 14th century dudes thought?

1. Intrinsically intersting.
2. Cultural history.
3. Thinking and writing clearly about hard subjects is valuable.

# Pasnau

## Belief

Here are some things I believe: \pause

- I have two hands.
- The Battle of Gettysburg was in 1863.
- Human action is causing global warming.

## Two Questions

Two questions about each of these beliefs: \pause

1. What would it take for these beliefs to be ideal, and how can we be more like that?
2. When is the belief good enough to assert/act on/hold?

## Pasnau's Focus

One big theme of his book:

- Philosophers used to care more about the first question, but they came to care more about the second.
- This was a mistake.

## The Ideal

If you like the first question, then some natural questions arise from it.

- Can we ever be epistemically ideal?
- If so, in what situations can we be ideal? Is it when thinking about mathematics, or our own minds, or, most optimistically, the external world.

## Pasnau

The book is primarily about two time periods:

- Early 14th century; and
- Late 17th century.

## Pasnau

- The body text, which we'll cover, is only about 1/3 of the book.
- The endnotes are fascinating, and while I encourage you to read them, they aren't required.

## Pasnau

- The book is very focussed on Western Europe; mostly France and England.
- It's a bit of a pity it didn't do more to connect the debates here to debates in Indian philosophy.

# Siegel

## An Example

| I'm sick and tired

## Two Epistemic Shortcomings

1. Short-sighted

2. Narrow-minded

## Epistemic Vices

| If we treat these literally, 
|     narrow-mindedness is a **vice**, 
|     while short-sightedness is at worst a **misfortune**.

## A Simple Picture of Empirical Knowledge

1. We get inputs from reality via our perceptual system.
2. We use our minds to figure out more things about the world using these inputs.

## Philosophical Differences Between Stages

- If dualism is true, the first is carried out by our body, the second by our mind.

## Philosophical Differences Between Stages

- Even if that's not right, philosophy has something to say about the second, but not really about the first.

## Philosophical Differences Between Stages

- Relatedly, we criticise people for doing badly at the second, but not the first.

## Some Questions

1. Where is the perception/inference boundary?
2. What are the inputs that perception provides to inference?
3. Does the postulation of a boundary make sense given modern biological theories?
4. Does the two-stage, dualist, picture make sense?

## Two Radical Views

- Philosophical, evaluative, terms are appropriate either side of the boundary. We can talk about the **Rationality of Perception**.
- The boundary does not in fact make sense, and should be abandoned as pre-scientific.

## Motivation for Radicalism

Prejudiced seeing

# Four Issues in Epistemology

## Ways of Knowing

- How many distinct ways of knowing are there?
- Is testimony one of them?

## Justification

Is having a justified belief more a matter of:

- Having a well-ordered mind?; or
- Having a reliable connection to reality?

## Knowledge

- What is the difference betewen knowledge and lucky guesses?

## Scepticism

- Do we know anything about the external world?
- If so, how and why do sceptical arguments fail?

## For Next Time

- We will start a fair way back, with a (very quick!) survey of some issues that come up in Classical Indian Epistemology.
