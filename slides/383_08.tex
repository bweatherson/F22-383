\begin{frame}{Plan for Today}
\protect\hypertarget{plan-for-today}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Two short sections: one on internalism/externalism, and one on the
  place of epistemology in philosophy.
\item
  Two long sections: one on ``sensitivity'' accounts of knowledge, and
  one on virtue.
\item
  Some of this might run on to Wednesday.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism (Again)}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-again}{}
I want to go over two similar ways to understand internalism about
rationality. (Or justification; you can replace the words throughout.)

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  These are going to be related; they are both ways to understand
  internalism.
\item
  But I don't think I did a good job of distinguishing them so far,
  which has led to confusion.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism as an Argument}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-as-an-argument}{}
Is this a valid argument?

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  A is being rational.
\item
  A and B are exactly alike on the inside; they are internal duplicates.
\item
  So, B is being rational.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism as an Argument}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-as-an-argument-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Internalists say it is; anyone who is internally like a rational
  person is rational.
\item
  Equivalently: Rationality never differs between internal duplicates.
\item
  Externalists say it is not; A and B might differ in how they are
  connected to the world.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Example}
\protect\hypertarget{an-example}{}
A and B both, without being consciously aware of it, or having given it
much thought, have the habit of believing people who look them in the
eye when telling them something.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  To make it realistic, assume that they have some limits to this, but
  it's their general habit.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Example}
\protect\hypertarget{an-example-1}{}
A and B both, without being consciously aware of it, or having given it
much thought, have the habit of believing people who look them in the
eye when telling them something.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  This will go well for A, but will go badly for B, since they live in a
  land of compulsive liars.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism vs Externalism}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-vs-externalism}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Internalists differ on what to say about these folks, but they say A
  and B are alike: both rational or both irrational.
\item
  Externalists typically say that A is rational, because reliable, and B
  is irrational, because unreliable.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism as an Explanation}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-as-an-explanation}{}
So that's take one; internalism accepts this A-to-B argument, and
externalism rejects it.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  But we can also distinguish the views by just looking at one person.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism as an Explanation}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-as-an-explanation-1}{}
Consider any case where A is being rational.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  We can always ask, what features of A make them rational?
\item
  It's never a brute fact that someone is rational; there is always some
  more underlying fact.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism as an Explanation}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-as-an-explanation-2}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Internalists say those underlying facts are all internal.
\item
  Externalists say that some of the underlying facts are (at least
  sometimes) external.
\item
  E.g., they include the reliability of the process that is being used.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Internalism as an Explanation}
\protect\hypertarget{internalism-as-an-explanation-3}{}
If I say someone is rational, the internalist says I'm just talking
about that person, the externalist says that I'm talking about how that
person is related to the world.
\end{frame}

\hypertarget{sensitivity}{%
\section{Sensitivity}\label{sensitivity}}

\begin{frame}{Zagzebski}
\protect\hypertarget{zagzebski}{}
No viable theory of knowledge can say that knowledge consists of these
three features:

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  S believes that \(p\).
\item
  \(p\) is true.
\item
  S's belief has feature F, where F (a) is preserved by logical
  inference, and (b) does not imply truth.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two Ways Out}
\protect\hypertarget{two-ways-out}{}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Make F not be closed under logical inference.
\item
  Make F imply truth.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sensitivity}
\protect\hypertarget{sensitivity-1}{}
This part of the lecture , is about an approach that takes the first
option.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  It is called a sensitivity theory.
\item
  The person most associated with this view is the late Harvard
  philosopher Robert Nozick.
\item
  I'm going to look at a greatly simplified version of Nozick's view.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sensitivity Theory}
\protect\hypertarget{sensitivity-theory}{}
S knows that \(p\) just in case.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  S believes that \(p\).
\item
  \(p\) is true.
\item
  If \(p\) were not true, S would not believe it.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simple Knowledge}
\protect\hypertarget{simple-knowledge}{}
Do I know I have hands? Yes, because all three clauses are met.

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  I believe I have hands.
\item
  I do in fact have hands.
\item
  If I didn't have hands, I wouldn't believe it.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weird Knowledge}
\protect\hypertarget{weird-knowledge}{}
Say a HBIV is a handless brain in a vat, who is stimulated to have
experiences as of working at UM.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Do I know I'm not a HBIV?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weird Knowledge}
\protect\hypertarget{weird-knowledge-1}{}
Say a HBIV is a handless brain in a vat, who is stimulated to have
experiences as of working at UM.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  No, because the following is false.
\item
  If I were a HBIV, I wouldn't believe I wasn't one.
\item
  In fact the opposite is the case: If I were a HBIV, I \textbf{would}
  believe I wasn't one.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Argument}
\protect\hypertarget{an-argument}{}
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  I have hands.
\item
  So I'm not a handless brain in a vat.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  This argument is valid, and clearly so.
\item
  But the sensitivity theory says I know the premise, and not the
  conclusion.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Logic and Knowledge}
\protect\hypertarget{logic-and-knowledge}{}
Nozick argued this was a feature, and not a bug, of his theory.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  It explained why we were so worried by sceptical scenarios like the
  HBIV.
\item
  And he thought it got a bunch of other cases intuitively right.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potemkin's Actual Village}
\protect\hypertarget{potemkins-actual-village}{}
But there's a problem with the view. And it's easiest to illustrate with
a story.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Some of you will know of the story, almost certainly fictional, of
  Grigory Potemkin in Crimea.
\item
  He's meant to be overseeing rural development there, and Catherine the
  Great is going to come on a tour to see how it's going. (This part
  might be true enough.)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potemkin's Actual Village}
\protect\hypertarget{potemkins-actual-village-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  In the popular version of the story, there is very little development,
  so Potemkin puts these cutouts up along the river, so as Catherine
  sails past, it looks like there are villages.
\item
  In our version (also fictional!), Potemkin does get the villages
  built, and at the key moment, Catherine is looking at a nice, new, red
  house.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potemkin's Actual Village}
\protect\hypertarget{potemkins-actual-village-2}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  But Potemkin had a backup plan; if the house didn't get built, he
  would have put up a fake.
\item
  And the fake would have been white, not red, but it would have been
  convincing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Catherine}
\protect\hypertarget{catherine}{}
Does Catherine know there's a red house by the river?

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Yes; there is, she believes there is, and if there weren't a red
  house, she wouldn't believe that there was one.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Catherine}
\protect\hypertarget{catherine-1}{}
Does Catherine know there's a house by the river?

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  No! If there had been no house there, Catherine would still believe
  there was one, because the white fake would have fooled her.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Intuition Check}
\protect\hypertarget{intuition-check}{}
Is it plausible that Catherine can know there's a red house by the
river, and not know there's a house?

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  That seems very strange.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A More Complicated Case}
\protect\hypertarget{a-more-complicated-case}{}
Nozick's theory implies one can never have knowledge of the following
form:

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  I don't have the false belief that \(p\).
\item
  E.g., I don't have the false belief that the moon is made of cheese.
\item
  But surely I do know that I don't have that false belief, because I
  don't even believe it.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  Logic and Metaphysics?
\item
  Moral Philosophy?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical Traditions}
\protect\hypertarget{classical-traditions}{}
Mostly place it with moral philosophy.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  How to believe well is a sub-question of how to live well.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modern Traditions}
\protect\hypertarget{modern-traditions}{}
Note by `modern' here we mean roughly 1640-1890. (Or to 1914 if you care
more about world history than philosophy history.)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modern Traditions}
\protect\hypertarget{modern-traditions-1}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Epistemology becomes clearly part of the metaphysics side.
\item
  M\&E becomes the shorthand for that part of philosophy.
\item
  Still reflected in name of this course.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Metaphysics and Epistemology in Modern}
\protect\hypertarget{metaphysics-and-epistemology-in-modern}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  The main constraint on a metaphysical theory is that we have to be
  able to know about the world.
\item
  So epistemology and metaphysics are completely entwined.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethics and Epistemology in Contemporary}
\protect\hypertarget{ethics-and-epistemology-in-contemporary}{}
In the last generation or so, epistemology has moved back towards its
classical home in ethics.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item
  Moral approaches are helpful in epistemology.

\begin{frame}{Zagzebski}
\protect\hypertarget{zagzebski-1}{}
Two (maybe related) claims.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Knowledge is belief that is true, justified, and (at least in part)
  justifed because it is true.
\item
  Justified beliefs are ones that flow from exercises of the virtues.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sosa}
\protect\hypertarget{sosa}{}
Three claims, in increasing order of strength.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Virtues are central to epistemology.
\item
  What makes something a virtue is that it reliably produces true
  beliefs.
\item
  Knowledge can be understood in terms of virtues.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{AAA model}
\protect\hypertarget{aaa-model}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  A belief is \textbf{accurate} iff it is true.
\item
  A belief is \textbf{adroit} iff it is skilfully produced.

  A belief is \textbf{apt} iff it is accurate because adroit.
\end{itemize}

\protect\hypertarget{animal-knowledge-and-reflective-knowledge}{}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  These three conditions give one \textbf{animal} knoweldge.
\item
  As the name suggests, these are conditions that Sosa thinks even
  (non-human) animals can readily attain.
\item
  Actually a tricky question here about which animals have beliefs, and
  what it means to say an animal has a belief, but assuming they do,
  they can have AAA beliefs.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Animal Knowledge and Reflective Knowledge}
\protect\hypertarget{animal-knowledge-and-reflective-knowledge-1}{}
Reflective knowledge is animal knowledge that one has animal knowledge.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  It requires being able to reflect on one's own skills, and correctly
  judge that one has acquired true beliefs by the exercise of skill, in
  virtue of having skill at making this kind of judgment.
\item
  That's probably too much for non-humans!
\end{itemize}
