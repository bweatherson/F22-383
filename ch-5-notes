Pasnau Ch 5

1. The privileged present.
  - Do we really get this intuition?
  - Is it needed to get the point behind the "Anselmian glance"?
  - I think these are both interesting ideas; I'm not sure they are the same idea.
  
2. Understanding
  - This seems more useful; what is understanding.
  - If I just run through a whole lot of calculations, do I understand the answer.
  - Compare trying to get the course roster set; I can know that something is the only way to do it, but not understand why it is.
  
3. Talk about traditional interpretation of Descartes?
  - Maybe, though it's a little of antiquarian interest
  - Don't need God for clear and distinct ideas
  - Do need God for things that are no longer clear and distinct
  - Why did it seem circular
  
4. But what's the positive view of Descartes?
  - Having had clear-and-distinct in the past isn't valuable because (actually not sure why).
  - Def true that if you just care about reliability, knowing that anyone had clear-and-distinct-perception of p is good enough; that guarantees truth.
  - But is it scientia? Then you surely want something like B or C. Question: Is D good at all?
  - Moral testimony puzzles maybe?
